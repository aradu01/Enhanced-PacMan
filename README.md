# Enhanced-PacMan
MKS22X Konstantinovich AP Computer Science Semester 2 Final Project. (Damian Wasilewicz and Alexander Radu)

# Objective
To emulate the renowned Pac-Man arcade game, while adding some tweaks.  We've included a previous scores saver, laser feature, and a plethora of power ups.

# Controls
For one player, use the WASD keys.
For two players, one should use the WASD keys and the other should use the arrow keys.
When one has the laser powerup, player one should press Q in order to fire the laser, and player two should press L in order to do the same. Be careful when firing the laser, for its great power goes through everything: ghosts and even walls too.

# Changes
We've been able to make the Pac-Man icon rotate when it changes direction, including the opening and the closing of its mouth.
We've also been able to include pellet detection, pac-man to ghost detection and vice versa, ghost to laser detection, and detection while pacman is powered up or dead.
We've been able to implement a scores saving file mechanism that allows the user to view previous scores.
We've been able to employ a second player system so that the game maybe be played among two individuals.
We've been able to enhance the user experience by appealing to the auditory and visual senses.
We've added a "lives" system.
We've also added random map selection (difference being in powerup placement) from a few maps.
We've been able to develop a better user interface, one where you are able to view the amount of lives left and your current score.
