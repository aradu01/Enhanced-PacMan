# Enhanced-PacMan
MKS22X Konstantinovich AP Computer Science Semester 2 Final Project.

# Objective
To emulate the renowned Pac-Man arcade game, while adding some tweaks.  We've included a high scores saver, laser feature, and a plethora of power ups.

# Controls
For one player, use the WASD keys.
For two players, one should use the WASD keys and the other should use the arrow keys.

# Changes
We've been able to make the Pac-Man icon rotate when it changes direction, including the opening and the closing of its mouth.
We've been able to implement a scores saving file mechanism that allows the user to view previous scores.
We've been able to employ a second player system so that the game maybe be played among two individuals.
We've been able to enhance the user experience by appealing to the auditory and visual senses.
We've been able to develop a better user interface, one where you are able to view the amount of lives left and your currect score.
